<p>The  Grand  Jury  for  the  District  of  Columbia  charges:  </p>
<p><b>Introduction  </b></p>
<p>1.  
The  United  States  of  America,  through  its  departments  and  agencies,  regulates  the  activities  </p>
<p>of  foreign  individuals  and  entities  in  and  affecting  the  United  States  in  order  to  prevent,  disclose,  </p>
<p>and  counteract  improper  foreign  influence  on  U.S.  elections  and  on  the  U.S.  political  system.   U.S.  </p>
<p>law  bans  foreign  nationals  from  making  certain  expenditures  or  financial   disbursements  for  the  </p>
<p>purpose   of   influencing   federal   elections.   U.S.   law   also   bars   agents   of   any   foreign   entity   from  </p>
<p>engaging  in  political  activities  within  the  United  States  without  first  registering  with  the  Attorney  </p>
<p>General.   And   U.S.   law   requires   certain   foreign   nationals   seeking   entry  to   the   United   States   to  </p>
<p>obtain  a  visa  by  providing  truthful  and  accurate  information  to  the  government.   Various  federal  </p>
<p>agencies,  including  the  Federal  Election  Commission,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice,  and  the  U.S.  </p>
<p>Department  of  State,  are  charged  with  enforcing  these l

<p>the Grand Jury) to defraud the United States by impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful </p>
<p>functions of the government through fraud and deceit for the purpose of interfering with the U.S. </p>
<p>political and electoral processes, including the presidential election of 2016. </p>
<p>3. 
Beginning as  early as  2014,  Defendant  ORGANIZATION  began  operations  to  interfere </p>
<p>with  the  U.S.  political  system,  including  the  2016  U.S.  presidential  election. 
Defendant </p>
<p>ORGANIZATION  received  funding  for  its  operations  from  Defendant  YEVGENIY </p>
<p>VIKTOROVICH PRIGOZHIN and companies he controlled, including Defendants CONCORD </p>
<p>MANAGEMENT  AND  CONSULTING  LLC  and  CONCORD  CATERING  (collectively </p>
<p>“CONCORD”).  Defendants CONCORD and PRIGOZHIN spent significant funds to further the </p>
<p>ORGANIZATION’s operations and to pay the remaining Defendants, along with other uncharged </p>
<p>ORGANIZATION employees, salaries and bonuses for their work at the ORGANIZATION. </p>
<p>4. 
Defendants, posing as U.S. persons and creating false U.S. personas, operated social media </p>
<p>pages and groups designed to attract U.S. audiences.  These groups and pages, which addressed </p>
<p>divisive U.S. political and social issues, falsely claimed to be controlled by U.S. activists when, in </p>
<p>fact, they were controlled by Defendants.  Defendants also used the stolen identities of real U.S. </p>
<p>persons to post on ORGANIZATION-controlled  social media accounts.  Over time, these social </p>
<p>media  accounts  became  Defendants’  means  to  reach  significant  numbers  of  Americans  for </p>
<p>purposes of interfering with the U.S. political system, including the presidential election of 2016. </p>
<p>5. 
Certain Defendants traveled to the United States under false pretenses for the purpose of </p>
<p>collecting  intelligence  to  inform  Defendants’  operations.  Defendants  also  procured  and  used </p>
<p>computer  infrastructure,  based  partly  in  the  United  States,  to  hide  the  Russian  origin  of  their </p>
<p>activities and to avoid detection by U.S. regulators and law enforcement. </p>

<p>6. 
Defendant  ORGANIZATION  had  a  strategic  goal  to  sow  discord  in  the  U.S.  political </p>
<p>system, including the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  Defendants posted derogatory information </p>
<p>about  a  number  of  candidates,  and  by  early  to  mid-2016,  Defendants’  operations  included </p>
<p>supporting the presidential campaign of then-candidate Donald J. Trump (“Trump Campaign”) and </p>
<p>disparaging Hillary Clinton.  Defendants made various expenditures to carry out those activities, </p>
<p>including  buying  political  advertisements  on  social  media  in  the  names  of  U.S.  persons  and </p>
<p>entities.  Defendants also staged political rallies inside the United States, and while posing as U.S. </p>
<p>grassroots  entities  and  U.S.  persons,  and  without  revealing  their  Russian  identities  and </p>
<p>ORGANIZATION affiliation, solicited and compensated real U.S. persons to promote or disparage </p>
<p>candidates.  Some  Defendants,  posing  as  U.S.  persons  and  without  revealing  their  Russian </p>
<p>association, communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump Campaign and </p>
<p>with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities. </p>
<p>7. 
In  order to carry out  their activities  to interfere in U.S.  political  and  electoral  processes </p>
<p>without detection of their Russian affiliation, Defendants conspired to obstruct the lawful functions </p>
<p>of the United States government through fraud and deceit, including by making expenditures in </p>
<p>connection with the 2016 U.S. presidential election without proper regulatory disclosure; failing </p>
<p>to register as foreign agents carrying out political activities within the United States; and obtaining </p>
<p>visas through false and fraudulent statements. </p>

<p>as  a  Russian  corporate  entity.   Beginning  in  or  around  June  2014,  the  ORGANIZATION  obscured  </p>
<p>its  conduct  by  operating  through  a  number  of  Russian  entities,  including  Internet  Research  LLC,  </p>
<p>MediaSintez  LLC,  GlavSet  LLC,  MixInfo  LLC,  Azimut  LLC,  and  NovInfo  LLC.   Starting  in  or  </p>
<p>around  2014,  the  ORGANIZATION  occupied  an  office  at  55  Savushkina  Street  in  St.  Petersburg,  </p>
<p>Russia.   That   location   became   one   of   the   ORGANIZATION’s   operational   hubs   from   which  </p>

The  ORGANIZATION  sought,  in  part,  to  conduct  what  it  called  “information </p>
<p>warfare against the United States of America” through fictitious U.S. personas on </p>
<p>social media platforms and other Internet-based media. </p>
<p>d. 
By in or around April 2014, the ORGANIZATION formed a department that went </p>
<p>by  various  names  but  was  at  times  referred  to  as  the  “translator  project.”  This </p>
<p>project focused on the U.S. population and conducted operations on social media </p>

<p>July 2016,  more  than  eighty ORGANIZATION  employees  were  assigned  to  the </p>

The  Federal  Election  Commission  is  a  federal  agency  that  administers  the  Federal  Election  </p>
<p>Campaign  Act  (“FECA”).   Among  other  things,  FECA  prohibits  foreign   nationals  from  making  </p>
<p>any   contributions,   expenditures,   independent   expenditures,   or   disbursements   for   electioneering  </p>
<p>communications.   FECA  also  requires  that  individuals  or  entities  who  make  certain  independent  </p>
<p>expenditures  in  federal  elections  report  those  expenditures  to  the  Federal  Election  Commission.   </p>
<p>The  reporting  requirements  permit  the  Federal  Election  Commission  to  fulfill  its  statutory  duties  </p>
<p>of  providing  the  American  public  with  accurate  data  about  the  financial  activities  of  individuals  </p>
<p>and   entities   supporting   federal   candidates,   and   enforcing   FECA’s   limits   and   prohibitions,  </p>

The  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  administers  the  Foreign  Agent  Registration  Act  (“FARA”).   </p>
<p>FARA  establishes  a  registration,  reporting,  and  disclosure  regime  for  agents  of  foreign  principals  </p>
<p>(which  includes  foreign  non-government  individuals  and  entities)  so  that  the  U.S.  government  and  </p>
<p>the  people  of  the  United  States  are  informed  of  the  source  of  information  and  the  identity  of  persons  </p>
<p>attempting  to  influence  U.S.  public  opinion,  policy,  and  law.   FARA  requires,  among  other  things,  </p>
<p>that  persons  subject  to  its  requirements  submit  periodic  registration  statements  containing  truthful  </p>
<p>information  about  their  activities  and  the  income  earned  from  them.   Disclosure  of  the  required  </p>
<p>information  allows  the  federal  government  and  the  American  people  to  evaluate  the  statements  and  </p>
<p>activities  of  such  persons  in  light  of  their  function  as  foreign  agents.   </p>

<p><b>Object  of  the  Conspiracy  </b></p>
<p>28.  
The   conspiracy   had   as   its   object   impairing,   obstructing,   and   defeating   the   lawful  </p>
<p>governmental  functions  of  the  United  States  by  dishonest  means  in  order  to  enable  the  Defendants  </p>

Starting  at  least  in  or  around  2014,  Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  began  to  track  and  </p>
<p>study  groups  on  U.S.  social  media  sites  dedicated  to  U.S.  politics  and  social  issues.   In  order  to  </p>
<p>gauge   the   performance   of   various   groups   on   social   media   sites,   the   ORGANIZATION   tracked  </p>
<p>certain  metrics  like  the  group’s  size,  the  frequency  of  content  placed  by  the  group,  and  the  level  of  </p>
<p>audience  engagement  with  that  content,  such  as  the  average  number  of  comments  or  responses  to  </p>
<p>a  post.  </p>

Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  also  traveled,  and  attempted  to  travel,  to  the  United  </p>

KRYLOVA   and   BOGACHEVA,   together   with   other   Defendants   and   co-</p>

<p>their application process, KRYLOVA, BOGACHEVA, R. BOVDA, and their co-</p>
<p>conspirator  falsely  claimed  they  were  traveling  for  personal  reasons  and  did  not </p>
<p>fully disclose their place of employment to hide the fact that they worked for the </p>
<p>ORGANIZATION. </p>
<p>c. 
Only KRYLOVA and BOGACHEVA received visas, and from approximately June </p>
<p>4,  2014  through  June  26,  2014,  KRYLOVA and  BOGACHEVA traveled  in  and </p>
<p>around  the  United  States,  including  stops  in  Nevada,  California,  New  Mexico, </p>
<p>Colorado,  Illinois,  Michigan,  Louisiana,  Texas,  and  New  York  to  gather </p>
<p>intelligence.  After the trip, KRYLOVA and BURCHIK exchanged an intelligence </p>
<p>report regarding the trip. </p>
<p>d. 
Another co-conspirator who worked for the ORGANIZATION traveled to Atlanta, </p>
<p>Georgia  from  approximately  November  26,  2014  through  November  30,  2014. </p>
<p>Following the trip, the co-conspirator provided POLOZOV a summary of his trip’s </p>
<p>itinerary and expenses. </p>
<p>31. 
In order to collect additional intelligence, Defendants and their co-conspirators posed as </p>
<p>U.S. persons and contacted U.S. political and social activists.  For example, starting in or around </p>
<p>June 2016, Defendants  and  their co-conspirators,  posing online as  U.S.  persons,  communicated </p>
<p>with a real U.S. person affiliated with a Texas-based grassroots organization.  During the exchange, </p>
<p>Defendants and their co-conspirators learned from the real U.S. person that they should focus their </p>
<p>activities on “purple states like Colorado, Virginia &amp; Florida.”  After that exchange, Defendants </p>
<p>and their co-conspirators commonly referred to targeting “purple states” in directing their efforts. </p>

Case 1:18-cr-00032-DLF  Document 1  Filed 02/16/18  Page 14 of 37 </p>
<p>Use of U.S. Social Media Platforms </p>
<p>32. 
Defendants and their co-conspirators, through fraud and deceit, created hundreds of social </p>
<p>media accounts and used them to develop certain fictitious U.S. personas into “leader[s] of public </p>
<p>opinion” in the United States. </p>
<p>33. 
ORGANIZATION  employees,  referred  to  as  “specialists,”  were  tasked  to  create  social </p>
<p>media accounts that appeared to be operated by U.S. persons.  The specialists were divided into </p>
<p>day-shift  and  night-shift  hours  and  instructed to  make posts  in  accordance with the appropriate </p>
<p>U.S. time zone.  The ORGANIZATION also circulated lists of U.S. holidays so that specialists </p>
<p>could  develop and  post  appropriate  account  activity.  Specialists  were instructed  to write  about </p>
<p>topics  germane  to  the  United  States  such  as  U.S.  foreign  policy  and  U.S.  economic  issues. </p>
<p>Specialists  were  directed  to  create  “political  intensity  through  supporting  radical  groups,  users </p>
<p>dissatisfied with [the] social and economic situation and oppositional social movements.” </p>
<p>34. 
Defendants and their co-conspirators  also created  thematic group pages on social media </p>
<p>sites,  particularly  on  the  social  media  platforms  Facebook  and  Instagram.  ORGANIZATION-</p>
<p>controlled pages addressed a range of issues, including: immigration (with group names including </p>
<p>“Secured  Borders”);  the  Black  Lives  Matter  movement  (with  group  names  including </p>
<p>“Blacktivist”); religion (with group names including “United Muslims of America” and “Army of </p>
<p>Jesus”);  and  certain  geographic  regions  within  the  United  States  (with  group  names  including </p>
<p>“South United” and “Heart of Texas”).  By 2016, the size of many ORGANIZATION-controlled </p>
<p>groups had grown to hundreds of thousands of online followers. </p>
<p>35. 
Starting at least in or around 2015, Defendants and their co-conspirators began to purchase </p>
<p>advertisements on online social media sites to promote ORGANIZATION-controlled social media </p>
<p>groups, spending thousands of U.S. dollars every month.  These expenditures were included in the </p>
<p>budgets the ORGANIZATION submitted to CONCORD. </p>

<p>36. 
Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  also  created  and  controlled  numerous  Twitter </p>
<p>accounts  designed  to  appear  as  if  U.S.  persons  or  groups  controlled  them.  For  example,  the </p>
<p>ORGANIZATION created and controlled the Twitter account “Tennessee GOP,” which used the </p>
<p>handle @TEN_GOP.  The @TEN_GOP account falsely claimed to be controlled by a U.S. state </p>
<p>political party.  Over time, the @TEN_GOP account attracted more than 100,000 online followers. </p>
<p>37. 
To measure the impact of their online social media operations, Defendants and their co-</p>
<p>conspirators tracked the performance of content they posted over social media.  They tracked the </p>
<p>size of the online U.S. audiences reached through posts, different types of engagement with the </p>
<p>posts  (such  as  likes,  comments,  and  reposts),  changes  in  audience  size,  and  other  metrics. </p>
<p>Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  received  and  maintained  metrics  reports  on  certain  group </p>
<p>pages and individualized posts. </p>
<p>38. 
Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  also  regularly  evaluated  the  content  posted  by </p>
<p>specialists (sometimes referred to as “content analysis”) to ensure they appeared authentic—as if </p>
<p>operated by U.S. persons.  Specialists received feedback and directions to improve the quality of </p>
<p>their posts.  Defendants and their co-conspirators issued or received guidance on: ratios of text, </p>
<p>graphics, and video to use in posts; the number of accounts to operate; and the role of each account </p>
<p>(for example, differentiating a main account from which to post information and auxiliary accounts </p>
<p>to promote a main account through links and reposts). </p>
<p>Use of U.S. Computer Infrastructure </p>
<p>39. 
To hide their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation, Defendants and their co-</p>
<p>conspirators—particularly  POLOZOV  and  the  ORGANIZATION’s  IT  department—purchased </p>
<p>space  on  computer  servers  located  inside  the  United  States  in  order  to  set  up  virtual  private </p>
<p>networks  (“VPNs”).  Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  connected  from  Russia  to  the  U.S.-</p>

<p>including accessing online social media accounts, opening new accounts, and communicating with </p>
<p>real U.S. persons—while masking the Russian origin and control of the activity. </p>
<p>40. 
Defendants and their co-conspirators also registered and controlled hundreds of web-based </p>
<p>email accounts hosted by U.S. email providers under false names so as to appear to be U.S. persons </p>
<p>and  groups.  From  these  accounts,  Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  registered  or  linked  to </p>
<p>online social  media  accounts  in  order to  monitor  them;  posed  as  U.S.  persons  when  requesting </p>
<p>assistance from real U.S. persons; contacted media outlets in order to promote activities inside the </p>
<p>United States; and conducted other operations, such as those set forth below. </p>
<p>Use of Stolen U.S. Identities </p>
<p>41. 
In  or  around  2016,  Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  also  used,  possessed,  and </p>
<p>transferred, without lawful authority, the social security numbers and dates of birth of real U.S. </p>
<p>persons  without  those  persons’  knowledge  or  consent.  Using  these  means  of  identification, </p>
<p>Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  opened  accounts  at  PayPal,  a  digital  payment  service </p>
<p>provider;  created  false  means  of  identification,  including  fake  driver’s  licenses;  and  posted  on </p>
<p>ORGANIZATION-controlled  social  media  accounts  using  the  identities  of  these  U.S.  victims. </p>
<p>Defendants and their co-conspirators also obtained, and attempted to obtain, false identification </p>
<p>documents  to  use  as  proof  of  identity in  connection  with  maintaining  accounts  and  purchasing </p>
<p>advertisements on social media sites. </p>
<p>Actions Targeting the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election </p>
<p>42. 
By  approximately  May  2014,  Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  discussed  efforts  to </p>
<p>interfere  in  the  2016  U.S.  presidential  election.  Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  began  to </p>
<p>monitor  U.S.  social  media  accounts  and  other  sources  of  information  about  the  2016  U.S. </p>
<p>presidential election. </p>

Case 1:18-cr-00032-DLF  Document 1  Filed 02/16/18  Page 17 of 37 </p>
<p>43. 
By  2016,  Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  used  their  fictitious  online  personas  to </p>
<p>interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  They engaged in operations primarily intended </p>
<p>to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such </p>
<p>as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump. </p>
<p>a. 
On  or  about  February  10,  2016,  Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  internally </p>
<p>circulated  an  outline  of  themes  for  future  content  to  be  posted  to </p>
<p>ORGANIZATION-controlled social media accounts.  Specialists were instructed to </p>
<p>post content that focused on “politics in the USA” and to “use any opportunity to </p>
<p>criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump—we support them).” </p>
<p>b. 
On or about September 14, 2016, in an internal review of an ORGANIZATION-</p>
<p>created  and  controlled  Facebook  group  called  “Secured  Borders,”  the  account </p>
<p>specialist was criticized for having a “low number of posts dedicated to criticizing </p>
<p>Hillary  Clinton”  and  was  told  “it  is  imperative  to  intensify  criticizing  Hillary </p>
<p>Clinton” in future posts. </p>
<p>44. 
Certain ORGANIZATION-produced materials about the 2016 U.S. presidential election </p>
<p>used  election-related  hashtags,  including:  “#Trump2016,”  “#TrumpTrain,”  “#MAGA,” </p>
<p>“#IWontProtectHillary,”  and  “#Hillary4Prison.” 
Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  also </p>
<p>established  additional  online  social  media  accounts  dedicated  to  the  2016  U.S.  presidential </p>
<p>election,  including  the  Twitter  account  “March  for  Trump”  and  Facebook  accounts  “Clinton </p>
<p>FRAUDation” and “Trumpsters United.” </p>
<p>45. 
Defendants and their co-conspirators also used false U.S. personas to communicate with </p>
<p>unwitting  members,  volunteers,  and  supporters  of  the  Trump  Campaign  involved  in  local </p>
<p>community outreach,  as  well as  grassroots  groups that supported then-candidate Trump.  These </p>

<p>individuals and entities at times distributed the ORGANIZATION’s materials through their own </p>
<p>accounts  via  retweets,  reposts,  and  similar  means.  Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  then </p>
<p>monitored the propagation of content through such participants. </p>
<p>46. 
In  or  around  the  latter half of 2016,  Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators,  through  their </p>
<p>ORGANIZATION-controlled personas, began to encourage U.S. minority groups not to vote in </p>
<p>the 2016 U.S. presidential election or to vote for a third-party U.S. presidential candidate. </p>
<p>a. 
On  or  about  October  16,  2016,  Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  used  the </p>
<p>ORGANIZATION-controlled  Instagram  account  “Woke  Blacks”  to  post  the </p>
<p>following message:  “[A]  particular hype  and  hatred  for Trump  is  misleading the </p>
<p>people and forcing Blacks to vote Killary.  We cannot resort to the lesser of two </p>
<p>devils.  Then we’d surely be better off without voting AT ALL.” </p>
<p>b. 
On or about November 3, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators purchased an </p>
<p>advertisement  to  promote  a  post  on  the  ORGANIZATION-controlled  Instagram </p>
<p>account “Blacktivist” that read in part: “Choose peace and vote for Jill Stein.  Trust </p>
<p>me, it’s not a wasted vote.” </p>
<p>c. 
By in or around early November 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used </p>

<p>Clinton because she wants to continue the war on Muslims in the middle east and </p>
<p>voted yes for invading Iraq.” </p>

Starting in or around the summer of 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators also began </p>

<p>and groups on social media.  Defendants and their co-conspirators purchased advertisements on </p>
<p>Facebook to further promote the allegations. </p>
<p>a. 
On or about August 4, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators began purchasing </p>
<p>advertisements that promoted a post on the ORGANIZATION-controlled Facebook </p>
<p>account “Stop A.I.”  The post alleged that “Hillary Clinton has already committed </p>
<p>voter fraud during the Democrat Iowa Caucus.” </p>
<p>b. 
On  or  about August  11,  2016,  Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  posted  that </p>
<p>allegations  of  voter  fraud  were  being  investigated  in  North  Carolina  on  the </p>
<p>ORGANIZATION-controlled Twitter account @TEN_GOP. </p>
<p>c. 
On or about November 2, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used the same </p>
<p>account  to  post  allegations  of  “#VoterFraud  by  counting  tens  of  thousands  of </p>
<p>ineligible mail in Hillary votes being reported in Broward County, Florida.” </p>
<p>Political Advertisements </p>
<p>48. 
From at least April 2016 through November 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, </p>
<p>while concealing their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation through false personas, </p>
<p>began to produce, purchase, and post advertisements on U.S. social media and other online sites </p>
<p>expressly  advocating  for  the  election  of  then-candidate  Trump  or  expressly  opposing  Clinton. </p>
<p>Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  did  not  report  their  expenditures  to  the  Federal  Election </p>
<p>Commission, or register as foreign agents with the U.S. Department of Justice. </p>
<p>49. 
To  pay for  the  political  advertisements,  Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  established </p>
<p>various Russian bank  accounts and credit cards, often registered in the names of fictitious U.S. </p>
<p>personas created and used by the ORGANIZATION on social media.  Defendants and their co-</p>
<p>conspirators also paid for other political advertisements using PayPal accounts. </p>

<p>Staging U.S. Political Rallies in the United States </p>
<p>51. 
Starting in approximately June 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators organized and </p>
<p>coordinated political rallies in the United States.  To conceal the fact that they were based in Russia, </p>
<p>Defendants and their co-conspirators promoted these rallies while pretending to be U.S. grassroots </p>
<p>activists  who  were  located  in  the  United  States  but  unable  to  meet  or  participate  in  person. </p>

Case 1:18-cr-00032-DLF  Document 1  Filed 02/16/18  Page 21 of 37 </p>
<p>Defendants and their co-conspirators did not register as foreign agents with the U.S. Department </p>
<p>of Justice. </p>
<p>52. 
In order to build attendance for the rallies, Defendants and their co-conspirators promoted </p>
<p>the events  through  public posts  on their false U.S.  persona social  media accounts.  In  addition, </p>
<p>Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  contacted  administrators  of  large  social  media  groups </p>
<p>focused on U.S. politics and requested that they advertise the rallies. </p>
<p>53. 
In or around late June 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used the Facebook group </p>
<p>“United Muslims of America” to promote a rally called “Support Hillary. Save American Muslims” </p>
<p>held on July 9, 2016 in the District of Columbia.  Defendants and their co-conspirators recruited a </p>
<p>real U.S. person to hold a sign depicting Clinton and a quote attributed to her stating “I think Sharia </p>
<p>Law will be a powerful new direction of freedom.”  Within three weeks, on or about July 26, 2016, </p>
<p>Defendants and their co-conspirators posted on the same Facebook page that Muslim voters were </p>
<p>“between Hillary Clinton and a hard place.” </p>
<p>54. 
In or around June and July 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used the Facebook </p>
<p>group “Being Patriotic,” the Twitter account @March_for_Trump, and other ORGANIZATION </p>
<p>accounts  to  organize  two  political  rallies  in  New York.  The  first  rally  was  called  “March  for </p>
<p>Trump” and held on June 25, 2016.  The second rally was called “Down with Hillary” and held on </p>
<p>July 23, 2016. </p>
<p>a.  
In   or   around   June   through   July   2016,   Defendants   and   their   co-conspirators  </p>
<p>purchased   advertisements   on   Facebook   to   promote   the   “March   for   Trump”   and  </p>
<p>“Down  with  Hillary”  rallies.    </p>
<p>b.  
Defendants   and   their   co-conspirators   used   false   U.S.   personas   to   send  </p>

<p>help organize the rally.  To assist their efforts, Defendants and their co-conspirators, </p>
<p>through false U.S. personas, offered money to certain U.S. persons to cover rally </p>
<p>expenses. </p>
<p>c. 
On or about June 5, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, while posing as a </p>
<p>U.S.  grassroots  activist,  used  the  account  @March_for_Trump  to  contact  a </p>
<p>volunteer for the Trump Campaign in New York.  The volunteer agreed to provide </p>
<p>signs for the “March for Trump” rally. </p>
<p>55. 
In or around late July 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used the Facebook group </p>
<p>“Being  Patriotic,”  the  Twitter  account  @March_for_Trump,  and  other  false  U.S.  personas  to </p>
<p>organize  a  series  of  coordinated  rallies  in  Florida.  The  rallies  were  collectively  referred  to  as </p>
<p>“Florida Goes Trump” and held on August 20, 2016. </p>
<p>a. 
In  or  around August  2016,  Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  used  false  U.S. </p>
<p>personas to communicate with Trump Campaign staff involved in local community </p>
<p>outreach about the “Florida Goes Trump” rallies. </p>
<p>b. 
Defendants and their co-conspirators purchased advertisements on Facebook and </p>
<p>Instagram to promote the “Florida Goes Trump” rallies. </p>
<p>c. 
Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  also  used  false  U.S.  personas  to  contact </p>
<p>multiple  grassroots  groups  supporting  then-candidate  Trump  in  an  unofficial </p>
<p>capacity.  Many of these groups agreed to participate in the “Florida Goes Trump” </p>
<p>rallies and serve as local coordinators. </p>
<p>d. 
Defendants and their co-conspirators also used false U.S. personas to ask real U.S. </p>
<p>persons to participate in the “Florida Goes Trump” rallies.  Defendants and their </p>
<p>co-conspirators  asked  certain  of  these  individuals  to  perform  tasks  at  the  rallies. </p>

Case 1:18-cr-00032-DLF  Document 1  Filed 02/16/18  Page 23 of 37 </p>
<p>For example, Defendants and their co-conspirators asked one U.S. person to build </p>
<p>a  cage  on  a  flatbed  truck  and  another  U.S.  person  to  wear  a  costume  portraying </p>
<p>Clinton  in  a  prison  uniform.  Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  paid  these </p>
<p>individuals to complete the requests. </p>
<p>56. 
After the rallies in Florida, Defendants and their co-conspirators used false U.S. personas </p>
<p>to organize and coordinate U.S. political rallies supporting then-candidate Trump in New York and </p>
<p>Pennsylvania.  Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  used  the  same  techniques  to  build  and </p>
<p>promote these rallies as they had in Florida, including: buying Facebook advertisements; paying </p>
<p>U.S. persons to participate in, or perform certain tasks at, the rallies; and communicating with real </p>
<p>U.S. persons and grassroots organizations supporting then-candidate Trump. </p>
<p>57. 
After the election of Donald Trump in or around November 2016, Defendants and their co-</p>
<p>conspirators used false U.S. personas to organize and coordinate U.S. political rallies in support of </p>
<p>then president-elect Trump, while simultaneously using other false U.S. personas to organize and </p>
<p>coordinate U.S. political rallies protesting the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  For </p>
<p>example, in or around November 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators organized a rally in </p>
<p>New York through one ORGANIZATION-controlled group designed to “show your support for </p>
<p>President-Elect  Donald  Trump”  held  on  or  about  November  12,  2016.  At  the  same  time, </p>
<p>Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators,  through  another  ORGANIZATION-controlled  group, </p>
<p>organized a rally in New York called “Trump is NOT my President” held on or about November </p>
<p>12,  2016.  Similarly,  Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  organized  a  rally entitled  “Charlotte </p>
<p>Against Trump” in Charlotte, North Carolina, held on or about November 19, 2016. </p>

<p>Destruction of Evidence </p>
<p>58. 
In  order to avoid detection and  impede  investigation by U.S.  authorities  of Defendants’ </p>
<p>operations,  Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  deleted  and  destroyed  data,  including  emails, </p>
<p>social media accounts, and other evidence of their activities. </p>
<p>a.  
Beginning  in  or  around  June  2014,  and  continuing  into  June  2015,  public  reporting  </p>
<p>began   to   identify   operations   conducted   by   the   ORGANIZATION   in   the   United  </p>
<p>States.   In  response,  Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  deleted  email  accounts  </p>
<p>used  to  conduct  their  operations.    </p>
<p>b.  
Beginning   in   or   around   September   2017,   U.S.   social   media   companies,   starting  </p>
<p>with  Facebook,  publicly  reported  that  they  had  identified  Russian  expenditures  on  </p>
<p>their   platforms   to   fund   political   and   social   advertisements.   Facebook’s   initial  </p>
<p>disclosure  of  the  Russian  purchases  occurred  on  or  about  September  6,  2017,  and  </p>
<p>included  a  statement  that  Facebook  had  “shared  [its]  findings  with  US  authorities  </p>
<p>investigating  these  issues.”    </p>
<p>c.  
Media   reporting   on   or   about   the   same   day   as   Facebook’s   disclosure   referred   to  </p>
<p>Facebook  working  with  investigators  for  the  Special  Counsel’s  Office  of  the  U.S.  </p>
<p>Department   of   Justice,   which   had   been   charged   with   investigating   the   Russian  </p>
<p>government’s  efforts  to  interfere  in  the  2016  presidential  election.    </p>
<p>d.  
Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  thereafter  destroyed  evidence  for  the  purpose  </p>
<p>of   impeding   the   investigation.     On   or   about   September   13,   2017,   KAVERZINA  </p>
<p>wrote  in  an  email  to  a  family  member:   “We  had  a  slight  crisis  here  at  work:  the  </p>
<p>FBI  busted  our  activity  (not  a  joke).   So,   I  got  preoccupied  with  covering  tracks  </p>
<p>together   with   the   colleagues.”   KAVERZINA  further   wrote,   “I   created   all   these  </p>
<p>pictures  and  posts,  and  the  Americans  believed  that  it  was  written  by  their  people.”  </p>

<p>66. 
On  or  about  July 12,  2016,  Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  created  and  purchased </p>
<p>Facebook advertisements for the “Down With Hillary” rally in New York. </p>
<p>67. 
On or about July 23, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used the email address of </p>
<p>a false U.S. persona, <a href="mailto:joshmilton024@gmail.com">joshmilton024@gmail.com</a>, to send out press releases to over thirty media </p>
<p>outlets promoting the “Down With Hillary” rally at Trump Tower in New York City. </p>
<p>68. 
On or about July 28, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators posted a series of tweets </p>
<p>through  the  false  U.S.  persona  account  @March_for_Trump  stating  that  “[w]e’re  currently </p>
<p>planning a series of rallies across the state of Florida” and seeking volunteers to assist. </p>
<p>69. 
On  or  about August  2,  2016,  Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  used  the  false  U.S. </p>
<p>persona “Matt Skiber” Facebook account to send a private message to a real Facebook account, </p>
<p>“Florida  for Trump,”  set  up  to  assist  then-candidate Trump  in  the  state  of  Florida.  In  the  first </p>
<p>message, Defendants and their co-conspirators wrote: </p>
<p>Hi there! I’m a member of Being Patriotic online community. Listen, </p>
<p>we’ve got an idea. Florida is still a purple state and we need to paint </p>
<p>it red. If we lose Florida, we lose America. We can’t let it happen, </p>
<p>right?  What  about  organizing  a  YUGE  pro-Trump  flash  mob  in </p>
<p>every Florida town? We are currently reaching out to local activists </p>
<p>and we’ve got the folks who are okay to be in charge of organizing </p>
<p>their events almost everywhere in FL. However, we still need your </p>
<p>support. What do you think about that? Are you in? </p>
<p>70. 
On or about August  2,  2016,  and August  3,  2016,  Defendants  and  their co-conspirators, </p>
<p>through the use of a stolen identity of a real U.S. person, T.W., sent emails to certain grassroots </p>
<p>groups located in Florida that stated in part: </p>
<p>My name is [T.W.] and I represent a conservative patriot community </p>
<p>named  as  “Being  Patriotic.”  .  .  .  So  we’re  gonna  organize  a  flash </p>
<p>mob  across  Florida  to  support  Mr.  Trump.  We  clearly  understand </p>
<p>that the elections winner will be predestined by purple states. And </p>
<p>we must win Florida. . . .  We got a lot of volunteers in ~25 locations </p>
<p>and it’s just the beginning. We’re currently choosing venues for each </p>

<p>wear a costume portraying Clinton in a prison uniform at a rally in West Palm Beach. </p>
<p>73. 
Beginning on or about August 11, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used the false </p>

<p>costume depicting Clinton in a prison uniform. </p>
<p>74.

<p>one of their false U.S. persona accounts from a real U.S. person, a Florida-based political activist </p>
<p>identified  as  the  “Chair  for  the  Trump  Campaign”  in  a  particular  Florida  county.  The  activist </p>
<p>identified two additional sites in Florida for possible rallies. Defendants and their co-conspirators </p>
<p>subsequently  used  their  false  U.S.  persona  accounts  to  communicate  with  the  activist  about </p>
<p>logistics and an additional rally in Florida. </p>
<p>75. 
On  or  about  August  16,  2016,  Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  used  a  false  U.S. </p>
<p>persona Instagram account connected to the ORGANIZATION-created group “Tea Party News” </p>
<p>to purchase advertisements for the “Florida Goes Trump” rally. </p>
<p>76. 
On or about August 18, 2016, the real “Florida for Trump” Facebook account responded to </p>
<p>the false U.S. persona “Matt Skiber” account with instructions to contact a member of the Trump </p>

<p>Campaign  Official  1’s  email  address  at  the  campaign  domain  <a href="http:donaldtrump.com">donaldtrump.com</a>. 
On </p>
<p>approximately the same day, Defendants and their co-conspirators used the email address of a false </p>
<p>U.S.  persona,  <a href="mailto:joshmilton024@gmail.com">joshmilton024@gmail.com,  </a>to  send  an  email  to  Campaign  Official  1  at  that </p>
<p><a href="http:donaldtrump.com">donaldtrump.com </a>email account, which read in part: </p>
<p>Hello [Campaign Official 1], [w]e are organizing a state-wide event </p>
<p>in  Florida  on August,  20  to  support  Mr. Trump.  Let  us  introduce </p>
<p>ourselves first.  “Being Patriotic” is a grassroots conservative online </p>
<p>movement trying to unite people offline. . . .  [W]e gained a huge lot </p>
<p>of followers and decided to somehow help Mr. Trump get elected. </p>
<p>You know, simple yelling on the Internet is not enough. There should </p>
<p>be real action. We organized rallies in New York before. Now we’re </p>
<p>focusing on purple states such as Florida. </p>
<p>The email also identified thirteen “confirmed locations” in Florida for the rallies and requested the </p>
<p>campaign provide “assistance in each location.” </p>
<p>77. 
On  or  about  August  18,  2016,  Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  sent  money  via </p>
<p>interstate wire to another real U.S. person recruited by the ORGANIZATION, using one of their </p>
<p>false U.S. personas, to build a cage large enough to hold an actress depicting Clinton in a prison </p>
<p>uniform. </p>
<p>78. 
On or about August 19, 2016, a supporter of the Trump Campaign sent a message to the </p>
<p>ORGANIZATION-controlled “March for Trump” Twitter account about a member of the Trump </p>
<p>Campaign (“Campaign Official 2”) who was involved in the campaign’s Florida operations and </p>
<p>provided Campaign Official 2’s email address at the domain <a href="http:donaldtrump.com">donaldtrump.com.  </a>On or about the </p>
<p>same 
day, 
Defendants 
and 
their  co-conspirators 
used 
the  false  U.S. 
persona </p>

<p>Campaign (“Campaign Official 3”) involved in the campaign’s Florida operations.  On or about </p>
<p>August 20, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used the “Matt Skiber” Facebook account </p>
<p>to contact Campaign Official 3. </p>
<p>80. 
On  or  about August  19,  2016,  Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  used  the  false  U.S. </p>
<p>persona  “Matt  Skiber”  account  to  write  to  the  real  U.S.  person  affiliated  with  a  Texas-based </p>
<p>grassroots organization who previously had advised the false persona to focus on “purple states </p>
<p>like Colorado, Virginia &amp; Florida.”  Defendants and their co-conspirators told that U.S. person, </p>
<p>“We were thinking about your recommendation to focus on purple states and this is what we’re </p>
<p>organizing in FL.”  Defendants and their co-conspirators then sent a link to the Facebook event </p>
<p>page for the Florida rallies and asked that person to send the information to Tea Party members in </p>
<p>Florida.  The  real  U.S.  person  stated  that  he/she  would  share  among  his/her  own  social  media </p>
<p>contacts, who would pass on the information. </p>
<p>81. 
On  or  about August  24,  2016,  Defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  updated  an  internal </p>
<p>ORGANIZATION  list  of  over  100  real  U.S.  persons  contacted  through  ORGANIZATION-</p>
<p>controlled  false  U.S.  persona  accounts  and  tracked  to  monitor  recruitment  efforts  and  requests. </p>
<p>The list included contact information for the U.S. persons, a summary of their political views, and </p>
<p>activities they had been asked to perform by Defendants and their co-conspirators. </p>
<p>82. 
On or about August 31, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, using a U.S. persona, </p>
<p>spoke  by telephone  with  a  real  U.S.  person  affiliated  with  a  grassroots  group  in  Florida.  That </p>
<p>individual requested assistance in organizing a rally in Miami, Florida.  On or about September 9, </p>
<p>2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators sent the group an interstate wire to pay for materials </p>
<p>needed for the Florida rally on or about September 11, 2016. </p>
